# Architecture Overview
 
CoreBrain uses a modular and scalable architecture designed to process natural language queries, interact with MongoDB databases, and provide contextual responses using advanced language models.
 
## General Architecture

The system is divided into three main components:
 
1. **api.corebrain.ai**: The FastAPI-based backend that handles requests, manages authentication, and communicates with external services.
2. **dashboard.corebrain.ai**: The admin interface for users to manage their account, API keys, and analytics.
3. **sdk.corebrain.ai**: The SDK that allows developers to easily integrate CoreBrain into their applications.
 
## Data Flow
 
1. The client application sends a request through the CoreBrain SDK.
2. The SDK formats the request and sends it to the API.
3. The API authenticates the request and checks permissions.
4. If the request involves a database query, it is processed through the natural-language-to-MongoDB engine.
5. The result is combined with the conversation context and sent to the language model (Claude).
6. The modelâ€™s response is processed and returned to the client.
 
## Technology Components
 
### Backend (API)
 
- **FastAPI**: High-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+
- **Motor/PyMongo**: Asynchronous MongoDB client for Python
- **Anthropic SDK**: Official client to interact with the Claude API
- **Redis**: For caching and rate limiting
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management
 
### Frontend (Dashboard)
 
- **React/Next.js**: Frontend framework for the user interface
- **TypeScript**: Static typing to improve code quality
- **TailwindCSS**: CSS framework for styling
- **React Query**: Server-state management
- **Recharts**: Charting library for data visualization
 
### SDK
 
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Main SDK for web applications
- **Python**: SDK for backend applications and data analysis
- **Node.js**: SDK for server-side applications
 
## Security
 
CoreBrain implements multiple layers of security:
 
- **API Keys with permission levels**: Each API key has a specific access level (read, write, admin).
- **Query sanitization**: All MongoDB queries are sanitized to prevent injections.
- **Collection access control**: API keys can only access specific collections.
- **Rate limiting**: Request limiting to prevent abuse.
- **Encryption in transit**: All communications use HTTPS/TLS.
- **Extensive logging**: Detailed logs of all operations for auditing purposes.
